    <h1>My Journey into Software Development</h1>
    <h2>By Harshal Prajapati</h2>
    <h2>From Engineering to Building Real-World Web Applications</h2>
    <p>
      When I began my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering at <strong>Alpha College of Engineering and Technology (2020–2024)</strong>, I was fascinated by how software could solve real problems. That curiosity became the foundation of my journey into mobile and web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my time in college, I sharpened my fundamentals through coursework while also exploring practical projects. By the time I completed my studies, I had not only learned the theory but also built real applications that I could proudly share.
    </p>

    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
    <p>
      In early 2024, I joined <strong>Elsner Technologies Pvt. Ltd.</strong> as a <strong>Flutter Intern</strong>. Over six months, I immersed myself in the <strong>Flutter SDK</strong> and <strong>Dart programming language</strong>. This experience strengthened my grasp of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Most importantly, I learned how to create <strong>cross-platform mobile apps</strong> that balance performance with user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that, in 2023, I completed a <strong>Java program at Samyak Computer Classes</strong>, where I built a <strong>chatting application</strong> using Java, Swing, and AWT. This project gave me insight into how desktop applications handle real-time communication.
    </p>

    <h2>Projects That Shaped Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Calculator App (Flutter, Dart):</strong> A clean, fast, and efficient cross-platform calculator.</li>
      <li><strong>E-Library App (Flutter, Dart):</strong> A mobile app that lets readers access trending and new-release books on the go.</li>
      <li><strong>Chatting App (Java, Swing, AWT):</strong> A versatile communication platform that provides an interactive chatting experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Each of these projects taught me valuable lessons in <strong>UI design, performance optimization, and user-focused development</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills and Tools</h2>
    <p>
      My technical toolkit includes <strong>Dart, Java, Android, HTML, CSS</strong>, and <strong>RESTful APIs</strong>. I’m comfortable working with <strong>Flutter</strong> for app development, and I rely on tools like <strong>Android Studio, VS Code, and Eclipse</strong>. For databases, I’ve worked with <strong>Firebase, Hive, and Shared Preferences</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      What excites me most about software development is its <strong>limitless scope for innovation</strong>. Whether it’s building seamless mobile experiences or experimenting with backend systems, I enjoy solving problems and delivering meaningful applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I continue my journey, I aim to contribute to projects that combine <strong>creativity, performance, and impact</strong> — and to grow as a developer who builds technology for people, not just devices. Right now, I am also learning <strong>Web Development</strong> to expand my skills even further.
